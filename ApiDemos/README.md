Google Maps Android API Demos
===================================

These are demos for the [Google Maps Android API v2](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-api/).
They demonstrate most of the features available in the API.

This app was written for a minSdk of 9 and the v4 support library, but it can be easily adapted to
use native functionality instead.
(For example replacing ``SupportMapFragment`` with ``MapFragment``.)

Pre-requisites
--------------

- Android SDK v23
- Latest Android Build Tools
- Android Support Repository

Getting Started
---------------

This sample use the Gradle build system.

First download the samples by cloning this repository or downloading an archived
snapshot. (See the options at the top of the page.)

In Android Studio, use the "Import non-Android Studio project" or 
"Import Project" option. Next select the ApiDemos/ directory that you downloaded
from this repository.
If prompted for a gradle configuration accept the default settings. 

Alternatively use the "gradlew build" command to build the project directly.

Don't forget to add your API key to the file ``debug/values/google_maps_api.xml`` for your debug keystore.
